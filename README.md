# Runge-Kutta
Resolution of Schrödinger equation via Runge-Kutta method and pull method.
We are now solving this equation with Runge-Kutta method of one electron in in a potential of’1D oscillator.
## Schrödinger equation

$$\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m_e}\partial_x^2 \phi(x) +V(x) \phi(x)=E\phi(x)$$

We used integral methods (see more in my other repository).

Net, we study the effect of fourth order anharmonicity:

$$V_2(x)=\frac{1}{2} m_e \omega^2 x^2 +\beta x^4$$
